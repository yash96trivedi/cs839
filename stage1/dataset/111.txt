<f><n>Elton</n></f> plays Paris charity concert

<f><p>Sir</p> <n>Elton John</n></f> has performed at a special concert in Paris to raise money for the victims of the Asian tsunami.

The British singer played to a 2,700-strong audience on Sunday at the French capital's Bastille opera house. The concert was also part of an attempt to bring a broader range of events to the famous venue. Money raised will go to the Fondation pour l'Enfance (Foundation for Childhood) which aims to rebuild a children's shelter in Sri Lanka. <f><p>Sir</p> <n>Elton</n></f> played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former French president <f><n>Valery Giscard d'Estaing</n></f> and his wife <f><n>Anne-Aymone</n></f>. The veteran pop star played piano accompaniment throughout the concert which lasted for three hours without an interval.

He told the crowd: "Throughout the years, I've done a lot of drugs and alcohol. It's true that I was a nightmare, impossible. For the last 14 years I've been normal. Now my drug is called <f><n>David</n></f>" - a reference to <f><n>David Furnish</n></f>, his partner. The crowd, who greeted each song with a standing ovation, also included French singer <f><n>Charles Aznavour</n></f> and British ambassador <f><p>Sir</p> <n>John Holmes</n></f>. <f><p>Sir</p> <n>Elton</n></f> has also teamed up with <f><n>Phil Collins</n></f> to record a version of <f><n>Eric Clapton</n></f>'s 1991 hit Tears In Heaven to raise money for the relief fund. A release date has yet to be set for the recording, which was organised by <f><n>Sharon Osbourne</n></f>.
