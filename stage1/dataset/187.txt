Double eviction from Big Brother

<f><n>Model Caprice</n></f> and Holby City actor <f><n>Jeremy Edwards</n></f> have both left the Celebrity Big Brother house in a surprise double eviction on Friday.

<f><n>Caprice</n></f>, who left in the scheduled fourth eviction having gained just 5% of the public vote, afterwards said: "I am so happy, I am so glad I'm out." <f><n>Edwards</n></f> then left in a surprise eviction, with 12% of the vote. Nineteen-year-old Blazin' Squad singer <f><n>Kenzie</n></f> is currently favourite to win the Â£50,000 charity prize. <f><n>Caprice</n></f> had been the pre-show favourite to be voted out of the house, with bookmakers Ladbrokes offering odds of 1/5 on her departure. Ladbrokes spokesman <f><n>Warren Lush</n></f> had said she was "the hottest eviction favourite so far this series".

Odds on <f><n>Kenzie</n></f>'s victory have been slashed from 4/6 to 1/2, although bookmakers have said they are not ruling out a late rally from former Happy Mondays star <f><n>Bez</n></f>. The other remaining housemate is actress <f><n>Brigitte Nielsen</n></f>. DJ <f><n>Lisa <f><n>I'Anson</n></f> became the third housemate to be voted out on Wednesday when she became the victim of a surprise eviction during a game of hide-and-seek on the Channel 4 show. <f><n>I'Anson</n></f> said she was "glad to be out" and predicted that <f><n>Kenzie</n></f> would emerge as the winner. The winner is due to be announced on Sunday night.
