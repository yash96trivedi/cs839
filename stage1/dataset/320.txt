<f><p>Mr</p> <n>Holiff</n></f>, who was also a concert promoter, managed <f><n>Cash</n></f>'s career between 1960 and 1973, quitting when he thought the singer's career had peaked.

An entrepreneur from an early age, <f><p>Mr</p> <n>Holiff</n></f> served as a rear air gunner in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, afterwards setting up a drive-in restaurant. He briefly dabbled in acting, before setting up offices in Nashville and Los Angeles for his concert and artist promotion business. In 1970, RPM weekly magazine presented <f><n>Holiff</n></f> with a special award as the Canadian music industry's man of the year. <f><p>Mr</p> <n>Holiff</n></f> retired when he was in his late 40s, returning to education as a mature student at the University of Victoria, where he graduated with a degree in history. He passed away on 17 March. According to his wishes, there will be no funeral service.
