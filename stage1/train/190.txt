In the mid-1990s, <f><n>Fletcher</n></f> said he had made a "fabulous living" since the age of 22 and had never had a day out of work.

He was most recently seen presenting a gardening programme for Channel TV. <f><n>Fletcher</n></f> was described as a "consummate professional" by his friend and fellow broadcaster <f><n>Michael Pointon</n></f>. "It really was a pleasure to work with him - he had met everyone and done everything," <f><p>Mr</p> <n>Pointon</n></f> said. "He was a whimsical, droll fellow, but also a very artistic man. As a friend, he was very kind, and generous." <f><n>Fletcher</n></f>'s daughter <f><n>Jill</n></f> said her father would be sorely missed. "He was greatly loved by the public," she said.
