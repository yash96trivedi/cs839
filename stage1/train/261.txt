The track, from their current album How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, pushed <f><n>Eminem</n></f>'s Like Toy Soldiers from number one to number three.

<f><n>Elvis</n></f>' Wooden Heart, which entered the chart at number two, is the sixth in a series of 18 reissues to mark the 70th anniversary of <f><n>Presley</n></f>'s birth. There are currently six re-released <f><n>Elvis</n></f>' tracks occupying spots in the top 40 singles chart including Are You Lonesome Tonight at number 20, It's Now or Never at number 27 and Jailhouse Rock at number 37. Soldier, by Destiny's Child, Ti and <f><n>Lil Wayne</n></f>, debuted at number four, while Almost Here, the duet from former Westlife star <f><n>Brian McFadden</n></f> and <f><n>Delta Goodrem</n></f>, fell from number three to number five.
