<f><p>Dirty</p> <n>Den</n></f>’s demise seen by 14m

More than 14 million people saw <f><p>”Dirty”</p> <n>Den</n></f> Watts killed off on Friday, marking EastEnders' 20th anniversary, according to unofficial figures.

<f><n>Den</n></f>'s death came 16 years after he was supposedly shot in 1989. But he came back to the show in September 2003. The audience for BBC One's one-hour special averaged 13.7 million and peaked at 14.2 million in the last 15 minutes, overnight figures showed. <f><n>Den</n></f> died after being confronted by <f><n>Zoe</n></f>, <f><n>Chrissie</n></f> and <f><n>Sam</n></f> in the Queen Vic.

If the ratings are confirmed, the episode will have given the soap its highest audience for a year. The overnight figures showed almost 60% of the viewing public tuned into EastEnders between 2000 and 2100 GMT, leaving ITV1 with about 13%. "We are very pleased with the figures," a BBC spokesman said. "It shows viewers have really enjoyed the story of <f><n>Den</n></f>’s demise." The show's highest audience came at Christmas 1986, when more than 30 million tuned in to see <f><n>Den</n></f>, played by <f><n>Leslie Grantham</n></f>, hand divorce papers to wife <f><n>Angie</n></f>.

Two years later, 24 million saw him apparently shot by a man with a bunch of daffodils by a canal. More than 16 million viewers watched his return in 2003. The show's ratings have since settled down to about 12 million per episode. <f><n>Grantham</n></f> hit the headlines in May after a newspaper printed photographs of him apparently exposing himself via a webcam from his dressing room. He also allegedly insulted four co-stars. He apologised for his "deplorable actions" and "a moment's stupidity".
