Cosmetic surgery series Nip/Tuck beat The Sopranos and Deadwood to the best television drama title.

The Golden Globes are awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, comprising film reporters based in Los Angeles and working for overseas outlets. <f><n>Robin Williams</n></f>, a five-time Globe winner for such films as The Fisher King and Good Morning, Vietnam, received the Cecil B DeMille award for career achievement.
