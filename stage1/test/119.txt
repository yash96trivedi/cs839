Ring of Fire hit co-writer dies

<f><n>Merle Kilgore</n></f>, co-writer of the country hit Ring of Fire, has died of congestive heart failure aged 70.

He started out as a singer and songwriter before going into music management, looking after country star <f><n>Hank Williams</n> <s>Jr</s></f>. He wrote Ring of Fire with <f><n>June Carter Cash</n></f>, the future wife of <f><n>Johnny Cash</n></f> who went on to score his most popular hit with the track. <f><n>Kilgore</n></f> had heart surgery in 2004 and was also diagnosed with lung cancer. His death has been attributed to treatment he was undergoing for the cancer. His first self-penned top 10 hit was Dear Mama in 1959.

One of the first songs he wrote for other artists was Wolverton Mountain, which sold 10 million copies when recorded by <f><n>Claude King</n></f>. He then wrote Ring of Fire with <f><n>June Carter Cash</n></f>, which was about her unrequited love for <f><n>Johnny</n></f>, who she later married. It was first recorded by her younger sister <f><n>Anita Carter</n></f> before <f><n>Johnny</n></f> went on to make such a success of it. <f><n>June Carter Cash</n></f> previously said it upset her husband when <f><n>Kilgore</n></f> talked about the song without crediting her and believed he should not have been credited on it. Last year, <f><n>Kilgore</n></f> turned up an awards dinner in a wheelchair expecting to honour <f><n>Hank Williams</n> <s>Jr</s></f>, but instead he was the surprise recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the International Entertainment Buyers Association.
