Celebrities get to stay in jungle

All four contestants still remain in I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here as no evictions were made on the television show on Saturday.

Contestants <f><n>Paul <f><n>Burrell</n></f>, <f><n>Joe <f><n>Pasquale</n></f>, <f><n>Janet Street-Porter</n></f> and <f><n>Fran Cosgrave</n></f> were told by hosts Ant and Dec. <f><n>Natalie Appleton</n></f>'s decision to quit the show last Monday had given them all a stay of execution, the group were told. Model <f><n>Sophie Anderton was the last person to be voted off the ITV1 show, set in the Australian jungle. The four remaining stars will do a joint <f><n>Bushtucker</n></f> Trial on Sunday.

Former All Saints singer <f><n>Natalie Appleton</n></f>,31, walked out of the show after learning she would face a fifth so-called Bushtucker Trial. The celebrities are chosen by the viewers to pass trials in order to win food for the rest of the camp. <f><n>Appleton</n></f> had endured a torrid time during the programme, including a well-publicised row with <f><n>Sophie Anderton</n></f>. And on 26 November singer Brian Harvey quit as a contestant after he had a blazing row with <f><n>Janet Street-Porter</n></f>.
