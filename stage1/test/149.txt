Spector facing more legal action

Music producer <f><n>Phil Spector</n></f> is facing legal action from the mother of the actress he has been accused of killing.

<f><n>Donna Clarkson</n></f>, whose daughter <f><n>Lana</n></f> was found dead in <f><p>Mr</p> <n>Spector</n></f>’s home in February 2003, is seeking unspecified damages in a civil action. The legal action accuses <f><p>Mr</p> <n>Spector</n></f> of murdering the actress at his LA home. <f><p>Mr</p> <n>Spector</n></f> is currently free on $1m (£535,000) bail and is awaiting trial. The 64-year-old has denied the killing, saying her death was accidental.

<f><p>Ms</p> <n>Clarkson</n></f>'s legal action, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also accuses <f><p>Mr</p> <n>Spector</n></f> of negligence and battery, alleging he "grabbed, hit, fought with and restrained" <f><n>Lana Clarkson</n></f> before shooting her to death. Her lawyers said in a statement: "The <f><n>Clarkson</n></f> family had hoped that there would be some resolution with regard to the criminal proceedings before moving forward with the civil action. "However, <f><p>Ms</p> <n>Clarkson</n></f> and her family understand that the fair administration of justice takes time and in light of the numerous changes <f><p>Mr</p> <n>Spector</n></f> has made in his legal defence team over the last two years, <f><p>Ms</p> <n>Clarkson</n></f> was forced to file the action before (the statute of limitations expired) on 3 February 2005." <f><p>Mr</p> <n>Spector</n></f>, known for his work with the Beatles, has claimed that Lana Clarkson committed suicide. His lawyers, led by Bruce Cutler, have vowed to prove him innocent at trial.

<f><p>Mr</p> <n>Cutler</n></f> said: “<f><n>Phil</n></f> did not cause the death of this woman, he's not criminally responsible and he's not civilly responsible either. "But I'm not surprised they filed a suit for money, that seems to be de rigueur nowadays." A Los Angeles Superior Court judge is expected to set a trial date later this month for <f><n>Spector</n></f>, who was indicted on murder charges in September. <f><n>Roderick Lindblom</n></f>, one of <f><p>Ms</p> <n>Clarkson</n></f>'s lawyers, said: "Our intent is to let the criminal proceedings go forward and not do anything that would interfere with the prosecution."
