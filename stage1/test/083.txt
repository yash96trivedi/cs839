<f><n>Cage</n></f> film's third week at US top

<f><n>Nicolas Cage</n></f> movie National Treasure has topped the US and Canada box office for the third week in a row.

National Treasure made $17.1m (£8.8m) in ticket sales from Friday to Sunday, according to studio estimates, taking its total to $110.2m (£56.7m). Comedy Christmas with the Kranks, starring <f><n>Tim Allen</n></f> and <f><n>Jamie Lee Curtis</n></f>, was in second place. The Polar Express entered in third place while <f><n>Jude Law</n></f> film Closer made its debut at number six.

<f><n>Oliver Stone</n></f>'s big-budget epic Alexander, starring <f><n>Colin Farrell</n></f>, followed last week's disappointing sixth-place opening with a slump to seventh place and takings of $4.7m (£2.4m). Critics have savaged the three-hour epic, which reportedly cost $150m (£77m) to make. National Treasure, which sees <f><n>Cage</n></f>'s character <f><n>Ben Gates</n></f> chase a hidden fortune, has been made by Disney Studios. It is <f><n>Cage</n></f>'s fourth collaboration with <f><n>Jerry Bruckheimer</n></f>, who is usually noted for his male-orientated action films.
